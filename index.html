              Stellar nebulae usually have a radius of around 1 light year and
              contain of gas of about 0.3 solar masses.<br /><br />
              All stars are formed from stellar nebula, which is a group of gas,
              dust, helium, and hydrogen. Gravity will slowly pull the dust and
              gas together. As these particles begin to clump together, the
              gravity gets stronger. When the collection of gas and dust become
              large enough, it will collapse from its own gravity and become a
              hot core for a star.

              Protostars can be from 0.01 to hundreds of solar masses.<br /><br />The
              hot core from the gas and dust in the stellar nebula becomes a
              protostar. Even though the core is hot, it is not ready for Fusion
              and Fission. The protostar is surrounded by gasses that sometimes
              get blown away by the magnetic field that forms when it rotates.

              A main sequence star is the most stable part of the star. This
              phase will last the longest.<br /><br />When the protostar spins,
              it will heat up to a million degrees, where it will start nuclear
              fusion. When creating fusion, the force will push against gravity
              and create a star. 90% of the universe is made of Main sequence
              stars. They can be a tenth of the sun mass or 200 times the sun
              mass, they can also live for millions to billions of years.

                When a main sequence star is less than 8 times of the Sun’s
                mass, it will start to collapse due to exhausted hydrogen.<br /><br />The
                gravity will push against the force of fusion, but squeezing the
                core will increase temperature and pressure. When there is a lot
                of temperature and pressure, Helium will start to turn into
                carbon, which releases energy. The hydrogen fusion will cause
                the star’s outer layer to expand and turn a red giant, which can
                appear more orange than red.

                contract and radiate energy. The expelled gas from the radiated
                energy will start to ionize, creating glowing rings around the
                core. On the outer layers, the molecules will cool and turn into
                metals. This “dying star” phase only lasts about a thousand to
                ten thousand years.

                When a Red giant sheds all of its atmosphere, only the core
                remains. A white dwarf is the size of Earth, but has more mass
                and that a teaspoon of its material could weigh more than a pick
                up truck. The white dwarf doesn't make any heat, and gradually
                cools down through billions of years. Sometimes white dwarfs can
                be found surrounded with a dusty disk of materials, debris, and
                planets.

                itself, forming a superdense mass or a star with extremely high

                dense that all of the matter is pulled in and essentially
